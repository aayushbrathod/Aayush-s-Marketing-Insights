                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>For decades, the USD has dominated global financial markets, so many countries hold dollars as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Countries keep foreign currency reserves as protection against “economic shocks” (Tutor2u). This allows them to maintain financial stability and prevent market collapse during periods of crisis.</p>

                        <p>Due to the rapid growth of digital-only currencies such as Bitcoin and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), speculation has increased about whether global trade could shift from the traditional USD to cryptocurrencies (Team, 2025; Digital & Analogue Partners, 2025). Tensions between countries have intensified discussions about the future of global reserve currencies. A small but growing number of countries are exploring digital-only currencies as potential successors to the US dollar, while others remain cautious (J.P. Morgan, 2024).</p>

                        <h2>Dollar Dependence and Risks</h2>
                        <p>Some countries may wish to reduce their reliance on the US dollar, as its value can be influenced by external factors such as investor sentiment, which in turn affects confidence and interest rates (Ox.ac.uk, 2025). Although digital currencies are growing rapidly, it is unlikely that they will be universally adopted, as global agreement would be required for cryptocurrencies to function as a primary reserve asset. Concerns about trust and long-term stability also remain significant (Chen, 2024). The USD is a fiat currency, meaning its value is derived from government authority rather than being backed by gold under the former gold standard (Best, 2024).</p>

                        <h2>History of the Dollar</h2>
                        <p>Before the Second World War, the US was a major weapons producer (Milliken, 2025) and accumulated gold through trade with its allies. As many countries depleted their gold reserves during the war, they were unable to return to the gold standard afterwards (Best, 2024). In 1944, 44 allied nations met at Bretton Woods to establish a new international monetary system (Arslanalp, Eichengreen & Simpson-Bell, 2024). This ultimately positioned the USD as the central reserve currency.</p>

                        <p>As the dollar became widely used, countries and companies had greater incentives to trade in USD, reinforced by the depth of US financial markets. Governments could invest in US Treasury bonds, strengthening trust in the currency (Conway, 2024). Today, the USD accounts for around 58% of global foreign exchange reserves (Arslanalp, Eichengreen & Simpson-Bell, 2024). The US’s political influence, military strength, and role within institutions such as the IMF further reinforce global confidence in the dollar.</p>

                        <h2>Digital Currencies</h2>
                        <p>Digital currencies are forms of money that exist solely on digital networks rather than in physical form (NatWest, 2023). Cryptocurrencies can be fully decentralised, while CBDCs are state-backed digital currencies. A decentralised currency is not controlled by a single government or bank (Bank of England, 2023). Bitcoin is one of the most prominent examples (Team, 2025).</p>

                        <p>Most cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology, a distributed digital ledger maintained across multiple computer systems rather than a single institution. Their decentralised structure makes them difficult for governments to control, which some consider an advantage over fiat systems (Chen, 2024). However, cryptocurrency prices fluctuate significantly, making them unreliable for reserve purposes and everyday transactions (Edwards, 2025). As long-term stability is essential for reserve currencies, the USD remains the more reliable option.</p>

                        <h2>Stablecoins and CBDCs</h2>
                        <p>Stablecoins attempt to reduce volatility by being backed by assets, often the US dollar (eToro, 2026). While this improves price stability, it reinforces reliance on the USD rather than replacing it.</p>

                        <p>CBDCs are digital versions of existing fiat currencies issued by central banks. For example, Nigeria introduced the e-Naira to simplify transactions (enaira.gov.ng). Unlike decentralised cryptocurrencies, CBDCs remain fully controlled by governments (Bank of England, 2023). While they modernise payment systems, they do not automatically challenge the dollar’s reserve status.</p>

                        <h2>Challenges and Advantages</h2>
                        <p>One argument in favour of digital currencies is that geopolitical tensions have increased concerns about US influence over global finance (J.P. Morgan, 2024). Some countries seek a more neutral monetary system that cannot be easily influenced by a single state (Digital & Analogue Partners, 2025). This could gradually reduce reliance on the USD.</p>

                        <p>Digital currencies may also offer logistical advantages, including lower cross-border transaction costs and greater accessibility (NatWest, 2023). These benefits could encourage further adoption. Some analysts suggest that, over time, digital currencies may reduce reliance on traditional fiat systems (Team, 2025). However, this remains a long-term possibility rather than an immediate shift.</p>

                        <h2>Limitations</h2>
                        <p>Despite growing adoption, significant obstacles remain. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. For instance, Bitcoin increased more than fivefold in early 2021 (Edwards, 2025), demonstrating extreme price swings that undermine its suitability as a reserve asset. Reserve currencies must maintain stability so central banks can manage inflation and respond to financial crises effectively (Bank of England, 2020).</p>

                        <p>Another limitation is that reserve currencies require deep, liquid financial markets and strong institutional backing (Conway, 2024). The US Treasury market is one of the largest and most trusted in the world. Its history of timely repayments and strong legal protections encourages central banks to hold dollar reserves. In contrast, decentralised cryptocurrencies lack comparable institutional safeguards (Team, 2025).</p>

                        <p>Global trade infrastructure further strengthens the dollar’s position. Commodities such as oil and gold are priced in dollars, and systems like SWIFT are heavily dollar-based (Best, 2025). This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: the more the dollar is used, the stronger its global position becomes. Replacing the reserve system would require coordinated international agreement and would be extremely complex to implement (Milliken, 2025).</p>

                        <p>Data suggests that digital currencies are unlikely to replace the USD as the global reserve currency in the near future (Arslanalp, Eichengreen & Simpson-Bell, 2024). The dollar’s dominance is supported by consistent usage, deep financial markets, and strong institutional frameworks (Federal Reserve, 2025).</p>

                        <p>Digital currencies may improve efficiency in international payments and coexist alongside the USD. However, without sustained stability and robust institutional structures, they are unlikely to dethrone the US dollar.</p>
